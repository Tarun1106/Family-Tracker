# Family-Tracker
This is a Mobile Application which is being developed mainly for the purpose of helping people to keep track of their family members and friends.
This app is developed in Android Studio.

To run this application in Android Studio

Step 1: Clone the repository or download it as zip file.

Step 2: Extract the zip file.

Step 3: Now open Android Studio

Step 4: Go to File->New-> Import Project

Step 5: After the Project has been imported run the Mobile Application.


To view the source code that I have written for the Mobile Application in github.

Just follow this path.


Go to the folder : app->src->main-> "java/com/example/gvta/family_tracker"(This is the folder name)

There will be four files:

1. Geolocation.java

2. Login.java

3. MainActivity.java

4. Register.java



If the application does not work I am just adding a report document about the work that has been done till now.
